James (BBC)
Patrick (Harmonic)
Nikos (MediaExcel)
Rufael (Unified Streaming)

Holiday in the US, small number of participants, call will be planned later, call will be short

Agenda
- review action points
- standardization approach
- issues with dash ingest draft specification

Review action points 

- Kevin povided text on readme.md, it was appended, it looked ok, no specific feedback. Note: eventually all this work/text will be bundled in a contribution that includes the motivation, requirements, architectures etc.
- Unified Streaming worked on the requirements (limited progress), and architectures (document available), architecture document was shared
illustrating the following: ingest to media processing, ingest to CDN, rendundant workflows (multiple encoder, multiple processing), and encoder disconnect. Feedback can be given offline, functinionality of media processing/origin was emphasized to illustrate the difference with pure CDN ingest
- list of issues on DASH ingest provided by Unified Streaming to be discussed later in the call

Standardization approach 
- choice standardization is important as to enable groups to decide on the participation (especially for large companies this will be important factor) 
- DASH-IF was proposed as starting point, MPEG as a place for the official standardization, which has an upcoming CfP in this area in NBMP targetting ingest and media processing, also DASH is already MPEG standard
- BBC considers ETSI, as it is closer to DVB/DVB DASH which the BBC is using 
- Comment by Nikos, we need to make sure to support things like DVBsubtitles and other DVB features, both in the ingest, or perhaps after the ingest, but also ATSC etc... DASH-IF provides a good mix for this
- discussion on the participation, BBC may not have enough resources in ETSI, MediaExcel, Harmonic, Unified Streaming all have resources in DASH-IF and MPEG, DASH-IF + MPEG standardization track should be targetted, especially to gain some more industry support in DASH-IF before going to MPEG which has very big companies and interests at stake
- Comment by Patrick on the second step after MPEG (Application standard e.g. DVB/ATSC), Ruafel: for online it is hard to point out such application standard. However (offline comment), there is some support to apply the MPEG NBMP in 3GPP to support ingesting media for edge based media processing, this could be an important emerging market

Issues with DASH ingest:

Rufael discusses the envisioned issues with DASH ingest (14 issues listed on github page), limited time for discussion and better offline, 
AP3.1: provide solutions to the list of issues needed to adress (USP,Harmonic,MediaExcel)
AP3.2: provide feedback when issues are unclear, issues mainly to trigger the discussion based on practical experience (Harmonic, MediaExcel)

Next call will be set in about two weeks, earlier was not a good option due to a tradeshow in London that is happenning next week. Rufael will contact some of the paricipant offline to inform them about the progress
