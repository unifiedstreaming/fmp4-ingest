             draft-mekuria-mmingest-01.txt

Abstract

   This Internet draft presents a best industry practice for 
   ingesting encoded live media to media processing entities. 
   Two profiles of the media ingest are defined covering the most 
   common use cases. The first profile facilates active media 
   processing and is based on the fragmented MPEG-4 format. 
   The second profile enables ingest of media streaming 
   presentations based on established streaming protocols. 
   Details on carriage of metadata markers, timed text, 
   subtitles and encryption specific metadata are also included.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a best practice for ingesting 
   encoded media content from a live source such as a 
   live video encoder towards distributed media 
   processing entities. Examples of such entities
   include media packagers, publishing points, 
   streaming origins and content delivery networks.
   The combination of live sources ingesting 
   media and distributed media processing entities 
   is important in practical video streaming deployments.   
   In such deployments, interoperability between 
   live sources and downstream processing 
   entities can be challenging. 
   This challenge comes from the fact that 
   there are multiple levels of interoperability 
   that need to be adressed and achieved. 
   
   For example, the network protocol for transmission 
   of data and the setup of the connectivity are important. 
   This includes schemes for establishing the ingest 
   connection, handling disconnections and failures,
   procedures for repeatedly sending and receving
   the data, and timely resolution of hostnames. 
   
   A second level of interoperability lies
   in the media container and coded media formats. 
   The Moving Picture Experts Group defined several media 
   container formats such as [ISOBMFF] and MPEG-2 Transport 
   Stream which are widely adopted and well supported. 
   However, these are general purpose formats, 
   targetting several different application areas. 
   To do so they provide many different profiles and options. 
   Detailed operability is often achieved through 
   other application standards such as those for 
   the broadcast or storage. In addition, the codec 
   and profile used, e.g. [HEVC] is an important
   interoperability point that itself also 
   has different profiles and options. 
   
   A third level, is the way metadata is 
   inserted in streams which can be a source 
   of interoperability issues, especially for live
   content that needs such meta-data to signal 
   opportunities for signalling ad insertion,
   or other metadata like timed graphics.  Examples
   of such metadata include [SCTE-35] markers which
   are often found in broadcast streams and other
   metadata like ID3 tags [ID3v2].

   Fourth, for live media handling the timeline 
   of the presentation consistently is important. 
   This includes correct sampling of media, avoiding
   timeline discontinuities and  synchronizing
   timestamps attached by different live sources.   
   
   Fifth, in streaming workflows it is important 
   to have support for failovers of both the live sources
   and the media processing entities. This is important 
   to avoid interruptions of 24/7 live services such 
   as Internet television where components can fail. 
   In practical deployments, multiple live sources
   and media processing entities are used. This requires
   the multile live sources and media processing to
   work together in a redundant workflow where 
   some of the components might fail.    

   This document provides an Industry best 
   practice approach for establishing these 
   interoperability points for live media ingest. 
   The approaches are based on known standardized 
   technologies and have been tested and deployed 
   in several streaming large scale streaming 
   deployments. Two key workflows have been 
   identified for which two different media 
   ingest profiles will be detailed.
     
   In first workflow, encoded media is ingested 
   downstream for further processing of the media. 
   Examples of such media processing could be any 
   media transformation such as packaging, 
   encrypting or transcoding the stream. 
   Other operations could include watermarking,
   content insertion and generating streaming manifests 
   based on [MPEG DASH] or [HLS]. What is typical 
   of these operations is that they actively inspect,
   or modify the media content and may 
   generate new derived media content. 
   In this workflow it is is important 
   to convey mediadata and metadata that 
   assists such active media processing operations.
   This is workflow type will be adressed 
   in the first profile.   

   In the second workflow, the encoded media is ingested 
   into an entity that does none or very minimal inspection
   or modification of the media content. The main aim 
   of such processing entities often lies in storage, 
   caching and delivery of the media content. An example
   of such an entity is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) 
   for delivering and caching Internet content. 
   Content delivery networks are often designed for 
   Internet content like web pages and might 
   not be aware of media specific aspects. In fact, streaming 
   protocols like MPEG DASH and HTTP Live Streaming have been 
   developed with re-use of such a media agnostic 
   Content Delivery Networks in mind. For ingesting 
   encoded media into a content delivery network it 
   is important to have the media presentation in a form 
   that is very close or matching to the format 
   that the clients need to playback the presentation, 
   as changing or complementing the media presentation 
   will be difficult. This second workflow is addressed 
   in profile 2.

   ============       ==============      
   || live   || ingest|| Content  ||   
   || media  ||====>>>||Delivery  ||==>>>> Client
   || source ||       || Network  ||  
   ============       ============== 
   
   Diagram 1 shows the workflow with a live media ingest from a 
   live media source towards an active media processing entity. 
   In the example in diagram 1 the media processing entity 
   prepares the final media presentation for the client 
   that is delivered by the Content Delivery Network to a client.
   
   Diagram 2 shows the example in workflow 2 were content 
   is ingested directly into a Content Delivery Network.
   The content delivery network enables the delivery to the client.   
   
   An example of a media ingest protocol 
   is the ingest part of Microsoft Smooth 
   Streaming protocol [MS-SSTR]. This protocol 
   connects live encoders to 
   the Microsoft Smooth Streaming server and to 
   the Microsoft Azure cloud. This protocol has shown 
   to be robust, flexible and easy to implement in live 
   encoders. In addition it provided features for 
   high availability and server side redundancy. 

   The first profile relating to workflow 1 
   advances over the smooth ingest procotol 
   including lessons learned over the last
   ten years after the initial deployment of 
   smooth streaming in 2009 and several advances 
   on signalling of information
   such as timed metadata markers for content insertion.
   In addition, it incorporates the latest media formats 
   and protocols, making it ready for current and 
   next generation media codecs such as [HEVC] 
   and protocols like MPEG DASH [DASH]. 
   
   A second profile is included for ingest of media 
   streaming presentations to entities were 
   the media is not altered actively, and further 
   media processing perhaps restricted to the manifests. 
   A key idea of this part of the specification is to re-use
   the similarities of MPEG DASH and HLS protocols 
   to enable a simultaneous ingest of media 
   presentations of these two formats using 
   common media segments such as based on [ISOBMFF] 
   and [CMAF] formats. In addition, in this 
   approach naming is important to enable direct 
   processing and storage of the presentation.
   
   Based on our experience we present 
   these two as separate profiles to 
   handle the two workflows. 
   We made this decision as it will 
   reduce a lot of overhead in the 
   information that needs to be signalled
   compared to having both profiles 
   combined into one, as was the case 
   in a prior version of this draft.
   
   We fruther motivate this best practice presented 
   in this document supporting using 
   HTTP [HTTP] and [ISOBMFF] a bit more. 
   We believe that Smooth streaming [MS-SSTR] 
   and HLS [RFC8216] have shown that HTTP usage 
   can survive the Internet ecosystem for 
   media delivery. In addition, HTTP based 
   ingest fits well with current HTTP 
   based streaming protocols including [DASH]. 
   In addition, there is good support for HTTP 
   middleboxes, HTTP routing available,
   making it easier to debug and trace errors. 
   The HTTP POST provides a push based 
   method for delivery for pusing the  
   live content when available. 
   
   The binary media format for conveying 
   the media is based on fragmented MPEG-4 as 
   specified in [ISOBMFF] [CMAF]. A key benefit of this 
   format is that it allows easy identification 
   of stream boundaries, enabling switching, redundancy, 
   re-transmission resulting in a good fit with the current 
   Internet infrastructures. Many problems in 
   practical streaming deployment often deal 
   with issues related to the binary
   media format. We believe that the fragmented 
   MPEG-4 will make things easier 
   and that the industry is already heading 
   in this direction following recent specifications 
   like [CMAF] and [HLS].
   
   Regarding the transports protocol, in future versions, 
   alternative transport protocols could be considered 
   advancing over HTTP. We believe the proposed media format
   will provide the same benefits with other transports
   protocols. Our view is that for current and near future
   deployments using [HTTP] is still a good approach. 

   The document is structured as follows, in section 2 
   we present the conventions and terminology used throughout 
   this document. In section 3 we present use cases and 
   workflows related to media ingest and the two profiles 
   presented. Sections 4-8 will detail the protocol and 
   the two different profiles.

   The PostURL the syntax is defined as follows using the 
   IETF RFC 5234 ANB [RFC5234] to specify the structure.

   PostURL = Protocol ://BroadcastURL Identifier
   Protocol = "http" / "https"
   BroadcastURL = HostName "/" PresentationPath
   HostName = URI_SAFE_IDENTIFIER
   PresentationPath = URI_SAFE_IDENTIFIER
   ManifestPath = URI_SAFE_IDENTIFIER

   In this PostURL the HostName is typically the hostname of the 
   media processing entity or publishing point. The presentation path 
   is the path to the specific presentation at the publishing point. 
   The manifest path can be used to signal the specific manifest of 
   the presentation. The rsegmentpath can be a different optional 
   extended path based on the relative paths in the manifest file.   
   The identifier describes the filename of the segment which is 
   corresponding to the manifest in the profile 2.

   using the IETF RFC 5234 ANB [RFC5234] as follows.
   
   fragmentedMP4stream = headerboxes fragments
   headerboxes = ftyp moov
   fragments = X fragment
   fragment = Moof Mdat
   
  This fragmentedMP$ stream is used directly in the ingest defined 
  in profile 1.

3.  Media Ingest Workflows and Use Cases

  In this section we highlight some of the target use cases
  and example workflows for the media ingest. 
  Diagram 3 shows an example workflow of media ingest with profile 1
  in a streaming workflow. The live media is ingested 
  into the media processing entity that performs 
  operations like on-the-fly encryption, content stitching 
  packaging and possibly other operations before 
  delivery of the final media presentation to the client. 
  This type of distributed media processing offloads 
  many functionalities from the live media source.
  As long as the stream originating from the media 
  source contains sufficient metadata, the media 
  processing entity can generate the media presentation
  for streaming to clients or other derived media 
  presentations as needed by a client. 

  Diagram 4 shows an alternative example with ingest 
  to a content delivery network, or perhaps another 
  passive media entity such as a storage. In this case
  the live media source posts the segments and the 
  manifests for the media presentation. 
  In this case, still fragmented MPEG-4 segments can be used, but the 

  Diagram 3: 
  Streaming workflow with fragmented MPEG-4 ingest in profile 1
  ============       ==============      ==============
  || live   ||ingest ||  Media   || HLS  || Content  ||  HLS
  || media  ||====>>>||processing||===>>>|| Delivery ||==>>> Client
  || source || fmp4  || entity   || DASH || Network  ||  DASH
  ============       ==============      ==============

  Diagram 4:
  Streaming workflow with DASH ingest in profile 2
  ============ingest ==============      
  || live   || DASH  || Content  ||   
  || media  ||====>>>||Delivery  ||==>>>> Client
  || source ||       || Network  ||  
  ============       ==============     

  Practice has shown that the ingest schemes
  can be quite different, and that combining 
  them into a single protocol will result in overhead
  such as sending duplicate information in the 
  manifest or ISOBMFF moov box, and increased 
  signalling overhead for starting, closing 
  and resetting the connection. Therefore, 
  the two procedures for media ingest in 
  such two common workflows are presented 
  as separate profiles in the next two sections.  

  In Diagram 5 we highlight some of the key 
  differences for practical consideration between 
  the profiles. In profile 1 the encoder can be 
  simple as the media processing entity can 
  do many of the operations related to the 
  delivery such as encryption or generating the streaming 
  manifests. In addition the distribution of functionalities
  can make it easier to scale a deployment with many 
  live media sources and media processing entities. 

  In some cases, an encoder has sufficient 
  capabilities to prepare the final presentation for the 
  client, in that case content can be ingested directly
  to a more passive media processing entity that provides 
  a more pass through like functionality. 
  In this case also manifests and other client specific
  information needs to be ingested. Besides these factors
  , chosing a workflow for a video streaming platform depends 
  on many factors. The media ingest best practice 
  covers these two types of workflows by two different 
  profiles. The best choice for a specific platform depends
  on many of the use case secific requirements and circumstances 
  and the available technologies. 

  In Diagram 6 we highlight another aspect taken into 
  consideration for large scale systems with many users. 
  Often one would like to run multiple encoders, 
  multiple processing entities and make them available 
  to the clients via a load balancer. This way requests
  can be balanced over multiple processing nodes. 
  This approach is common when serving web pages, 
  and this architecture also applies to video 
  streaming platforms that also use HTTP. In Diagram 
   6 it is highlighted how one or more multiple live encoders can 
  be sending data to one or more processing entities. In 
  such a workflow it is important to handle the case 
  when one source or media processing entity fails over. 
  We call this support for failover. It is an important 
  consideration in practical video streaming systems that 
  need to run 24/7. Failovers must be handled robustly 
  and seamlesslessly without causing service interruption. 
  In both profiles we detail how this failover and redundancy 
  support can be achieved.

4. Generic Ingest Protocol Behavior 

  The media ingest follows the following general requirements for both target profiles.

   1. The live encoder or ingest source communicates to 
      the publishing point/processing entity using the HTTP 
      POST method as defined in the HTTP protocol [RFC2626]
   2. The media ingest source SHOULD use HTTP over TLS [HTTPS]
      to connect to the media processing entity
   3. The live encoder/media source SHOULD repeatedly resolve 
      the Hostname to adapt to changes in the IP to Hostname mapping
      such as for example by using the dynamic naming system 
      DNS [RFC1035] or any other system that is in place.
   4. The Live encoder media source MUST update the IP to hostname 
      resolution respecting the TTL (time to live) from DNS 
      query responses, this will enable better resillience 
      to changes of the IP address in large scale deployments 
      where the IP adress of the publishing point media 
      processing nodes may change frequenty. 
   5. In case HTTPS protocol is used, 
       basic authentication HTTP AUTH [RFC7617] 
       or better methods like TLS client certificates SHOULD be used
   6. As compatibility profile for the TLS encryption 
      we recommend the ingest SHOULD use the mozzilla 
      intermediate compatibility profile which is supported 
      in many available implementations [MozillaTLS]. 
   7. The encoder or ingest source SHOULD terminate 
      the HTTP POST request if data is not being sent 
      at a rate commensurate with the MP4 segment duration. 
      An HTTP POST request that does not send data can 
      prevent publishing points or media processing entities 
      from quickly disconnecting from the live encoder or 
      media ingest source in the event of a service update. 
      For this reason, the HTTP POST for sparse  
      data such as sparse tracks SHOULD be short-lived, 
	  terminating as soon as 
      the sparse fragment is sent.

5. Profile 1: Fragmented MPEG-4 Ingest General Considerations

The first profile assumes ingest to an active media processing entity, 
from one or more live ingest sources, ingesting one or more 
types of media streams. This advances over the ingest
part of the smooth ingest protocol [MS-SSTR] by using 
standardized media container formats based on [ISOBMFF][CMAF].
In addition this allows extension to codecs like [HEVC] and 
timed metadata ingest of subtitle and timed text streams.  
The workflow ingesting multiple media ingest streams with 
fragmented MPEG-4 ingest is illustrated in Diagram 7.

============       ==============

In diagrams 8-10 we detail some of the concepts and structures. 
Diagram 8 shows the data format structure of fragmented 
MPEG-4 [ISOBMFF] and [CMAF]. In this format media meta data 
(playback time, sample duration) and sample data (encoded samples) 
are interleaved. the moof box as specified in [ISOBMFF] is used 
to signal the information to playback and decode the samples 
followed in the mdat box. 
The ftyp and moov box contain the track specific information 
and can be seen as a header of the stream, sometimes referred
as a [CMAF] header. The styp box can be used to signal the 
type of segment. The combination of styp moof mdat can be referred
as a segment, the combination of ftype and moof can be referred 
to as an init segment or a CMAF header. 

Diagram 8: fragmented mp4 stream: 
=========================================================
||ftyp||moov||styp||moof||mdat||styp||moof||mdat|| .....=
=========================================================

In diagram 9 we illustrate the synchronisation model, that
is in many ways similar, but simplified, from the synchronisation 
model propose in [CMAF]. Different bit-rate tracks 
and or media streams are conveyed in separate fragmented mp4 streams. 
by having the boundaries to the segments time alligned for tracks 
comprising the same stream at different bit-rates, bit-rate
switching can be achieved. By using a common timeline 
different streams can be synchronized at the receiver, 
while they are in a separeted fragmented mp4 stream 
send over a separate connection, possibly from a different
live ingest source. 

In diagram 10 another advantage of this synchronisation model
is illustrated, the concept of late binding. In the case 
of late binding a new stream becomes available. By using 
the segment boundaries and a common timeline it can 
be received by the media processing entity and embedded
in the presentation. Late binding is useful for many 
practical use cases when broadcasting television 
content with different types of metadata tracks.

Diagram 11 shows the flow of the media ingest. It starts with a 
DNS resolution (if needed) and an authentication step (Authy, 
TLS certificate) to establish a secure TCP connection. 
In some private datacenter deployments where nodes 
are not reachable from outside, a non authenticated connection 
could also be used. The ingest source then issues an empty POST
to test that the media processing entity is listening. It then 
start sending the moov + ftyp box (the init segment), followed
by the rest of the segments in the fragmented MPEG-4 stream. In 
the end of the session, for tear down the source can send an 
empty mfra box to close the connection.

6. Profile 1: Fragmented MPEG-4 Ingest Protocol Behavior

This section describes the protocol behavior specific to 
profile 1: fragmented MPEG-4 ingest. Operation of this 
profile MUST also adhere to general requirements in secion 4.

6.1. General Protocol Requirements

   1. The live encoder or ingest source SHOULD start
      by sending an HTTP POST request with an empty "body"
      (zero content length) by using the POSTURL 
      This can help the live encoder or media 
      ingest source to quickly detect whether the 
      live ingest publishing point is valid, 
      and if there are any authentication 
	  or other conditions required.	 
   2. The live encoder or ingest source MUST initiate 
      a media ingest connection by POSTING the 
      header boxes "ftyp" and "moov" after step 1	  
   3. The encoder or ingest source SHOULD use chunked transfer 
      encoding option of the HTTP POST command [RFC2626]
      as it might be difficult to predict the entire content length 
      of the segment. This can also be used for example to support use 
      cases that require low latency.
   4. If the HTTP POST request terminates or times out with a TCP 
      error prior to the end of the stream, the encoder MUST issue 
      a new connection, and follow the 
      preceding requirements. Additionally, the encoder MAY resend 
      the previous segment that was already sent again.	
   5. The live encoder or ingest source MUST handle 
      any error or failed authentication responses 
	  received from the media processing, by issueing 
	  a new connection and following the preceding 
	  requirements inlcluding retransmitting the ftyp and moov boxes. 
   6. In case the live stream event is over the live media 
      source or ingest source should signal 
      the stop by transmitting an empty "mfra" box 
      towards the publishing point/processing entity.
   7. The live ingest source SHOULD use a separate TCP
      connection for ingest of each different track
	  
6.2. Requirements for formatting Media Tracks
   
   1. The trackFragmentDecodeTime box "tfdt" box
      MUST be present for each segment posted.
   2. The ISOBMFF media fragment duration SHOULD be constant, 
      the duration MAY fluctuate to compensate 
      for non-integer frame rates. By choosing an appropriate 
      timescale (a multiple of the frame rate is recommended) 
      this issue SHOULD be avoided.
   3. The MPEG-4 fragment durations SHOULD be between 
      approximately 1 and 6 seconds.
   4. The fragment decode timestamps "tfdt" of fragments in the 
      fragmentedMP4stream and the indexes base_media_decode_ time 
      SHOULD arrive in increasing order for each of the different 
      tracks/streams that are ingested.
   5. The segments formatted as fragmented MP4 stream SHOULD use 
      a timescale for video streams based on the framerate 
      and 44.1 KHz or 48 KHz for audio streams 
      or any another timescale that enables integer 
      increments of the decode times of 
      fragments signalled in the "tfdt" box based on this scale.
   6. The language of the stream SHOULD be signalled in the 
	  "mdhd" box or "elng" boxes in the 
	  init segment and/or moof headers ("mdhd").
   7. Encryption specific information SHOULD be signalled 
	  in the "pssh","schm" and "sinf" boxes following [ISOBMFF] [CENC]
   8. Segments posted towards the media procesing entity SHOULD 
      contain the bitrate "btrt" box specifying the target 
	  bitrate of the segments 
   9. Segments  posted towards the media procesing entity SHOULD 
	 contain the "tfdt" box specifying  the fragments decode time 
	 and the "tfhd" box specifying the track id.

6.3  Requirements for Timed Text Captions and Subtitle streams

The media ingest follows the following requirements for ingesting 
a track with timed text, captions and/or subtitle streams.

   1. The track will be a sparse track signalled by a null media header 
       "nmhd" containing the timed text, images, captions corresponding 
	  to the recommendation of storing tracks in fragmented MPEG-4 [CMAF]
   2. Based on this recommendation the trackhandler "hdlr" shall 
      be set to "text" for WebVTT and "subt" for TTML following 
	  [MPEG-4-30] 
   3. In case TTML is used the track must use the XMLSampleEntry 
      to signal sample description of the sub-title stream [MPEG-4-30] 
   4. In case WebVTT is used the track must use the WVTTSampleEntry 
      to signal sample description of the text stream
   5. These boxes SHOULD signal the mime type and specifics as 
      described in [CMAF] sections 11.3 ,11.4 and 11.5
   6. The boxes described in 2-5 must be present in the init 
      segment (ftyp + moov) for the given track
   7. subtitles in CTA-608 and CTA-708 can be transmitted 
      following the recommendation section 11.5 in [CMAF] via 
      SEI messages in the video track
   8. The "ftyp" box in the init segment for the track 
      containing timed text, images, captions and sub-titles 
      MAY use signalling using CMAF profiles based on [CMAF] 
   
   8a. WebVTT   Specified in 11.2 ISO/IEC 14496-30 
        [MPEG-4-30] 'cwvt'
   8b.TTML IMSC1 Text  Specified in 11.3.3 [MPEG-4-30] 
       IMSC1 Text Profile   'im1t'
   8c.TTML IMSC1 Image Specified in 11.3.4 [MPEG-4-30] 
       IMSC1 Image Profile  'im1i'
   8d. CEA  CTA-608 and CTA-708 Specified in 11.4 [MPEG-4-30] 
       Caption data is embedded in SEI messages in video track; 
      'ccea'
	  
6.4 Requirements for Timed Metadata

  This section discusses the specific formatting requirements 
  for ingest of timed metadata related to events and markers for 
  ad insertion or other timed metadata  An example of 
  these are opportunities  for dynamic live ad insertion 
  signalled by SCTE-35 markers. This type of  event signalling 
  is different from regular audio/video information 
  because of its sparse nature. In this case, 
  the signalling data usually does not 
  happen continuously, and the intervals can 
  be hard to predict. Examples of timed metadata are ID3 tags 
  [ID3v2], SCTE-35 markers [SCTE-35] and DASH emsg 
  messages defined in section 5.10.3.3 of [DASH]. For example, 
  DASH Event messages contain a schemeIdUri that defines 
  the payload of the message. Table 1 provides some 
  example schemes in DASH event messages and Table 2 
  illustrates an example of a SCTE-35 marker stored 
  in a DASH emsg. The presented approach allows ingest of 
  timed metadata from different sources, 
  possibly on different locations by embedding them in 
  sparse metadata tracks.

Table 1 Example of DASH emsg schemes  URI

Value                   | the value of the SCTE 35 PID
Timescale               | positive number
presentation_time_delta | non-negative number expressing splice time
                        | relative  to tfdt 
event_duration          | duration of event
                        | "0xFFFFFFFF" indicates unknown duration
Id                      | unique identifier for message
message_data            | splice info section including CRC


  The following steps are recommended for timed metadata 
  ingest related to events, tags, ad markers and 
  program information:
  
  1. Create the metadata stream as a 
     fragmentedMP4stream that conveys the metadata
     , the media handler (hdlr) is "meta", 
     the track handler box is a null media header box "nmhd".
  2. The metadata stream applies to the media streams 
     in the presentation ingested to active publishing 
     point at the media processing entity	 
  3. The URIMetaSampleEntry entry contains, in a URIbox, 
     the URI following the URI syntax in [RFC3986] 
     defining the form  of the metadata 
     (see the ISO Base media file format 
     specification [ISOBMFF]). For example, the URIBox 
     could contain for ID3 tags  [ID3v2] 
     the URL  http://www.id3.org or
     or urn:scte:scte35:2013a:bin 
     for scte 35 markers [SCTE-35]
  4. The timescale of the metadata should match the value 
     specified in the media header box "mdhd" of the 
	 metadata track.
  5. The Arrival time is signalled in the "tfdt" box 
     of the track fragment  as the basemediadecode
     time, this time is often different
     from the media presentation time, which is occurs
     when a message is applied. The duration of 
     a metadata fragment can be set to zero, 
     letting it be determined by the 
     time (tfdt) of a next metadata segment received.
  6. All Timed Metadata samples SHOULD 
     be sync samples [ISOBMFF], 
     defining the entire set of 
     metadata for the time interval 
     they cover. Hence, the sync 
     sample table box SHOULD 
     not be present in the metadata stream. 
  7. The metadata segment becomes available to the 
     publishing  point/ media processing entity 
     when the corresponding track fragment 
	 from the media that has an equal 
	 or larger timestamp compared to 
	 the arrival time signalled 
     in the tfdt basemediadecodetime. 
     For example, if the sparse fragment 
     has a timestamp of t=1000, it is expected that after the 
     publishing point/processing entity sees "video" 
    (assuming the parent track name is "video") 
    fragment timestamp 1000 or beyond, it can retrieve the 
    sparse fragment from the binary payload.
  8. The payload of sparse track fragments is conveyed 
     in the mdat box as sample information. This enables 
     muxing of the metadata tracks. For example 
	 XML metadata can for example be coded as base64 as
     common for [SCTE-35] metadata messages
 
6.5 Requirements for Media Processing Entity Failover

  Given the nature of live streaming, good failover support is 
  critical for ensuring the availability of the service. 
  Typically, media services are designed to handle various types 
  of failures, including network errors, server errors, and storage 
  issues. When used in conjunction with proper failover 
  logic from the live encoder side, highly reliable live streaming
  setups can be build. In this section, we discuss requirements 
  for failover scenarios. 
  
  The following steps are required for a live encoder or media
  ingest source to deal with a failing media processing entity.
  
  1.    Use a 10-second timeout for establishing the
     TCP connection. 
    If an attempt to establish the connection takes longer 
    than 10 seconds, abort the operation and try again.
  2.    Use a short timeout for sending the HTTP requests. 
    If the target segment duration is N seconds, use a send 
    timeout between N and 2 N seconds; for example, if 
    the segment duration is 6 seconds, 
    use a timeout of 6 to 12 seconds. 
    If a timeout occurs, reset the connection, 
    open a new connection, 
    and resume stream ingest on the new connection. 
    This is needed to avoid latency introduced
    by failing connectivity in the workflow.
  3. Resend track segments for which a 
     connection was terminated early
  4.    We recommend that the encoder or ingest source 
    does NOT limit the number of retries to establish a
    connection or resume streaming after a TCP error occurs.
  5.    After a TCP error:
   a. The current connection MUST be closed, 
      and a new connection MUST be created 
      for a new HTTP POST request.
   b. The new HTTP POST URL MUST be the same 
      as the initial POST URL for the 
      segment to be ingested.
   c. The new HTTP POST MUST include stream 
      headers ("ftyp", and "moov" boxes) 
      identical to the stream headers in the 
      initial POST request for fragmented media ingest.
   6.  In case the media processing entity cannot process the 
       POST request due to authentication or permission 
    problems then it SHOULD return a permission denied HTTP 403 
   7.  In case the media processing entity can process the request
       it SHOULD return an HTTP 200 OK or 202 Accepted
   8.  In case the media processing entity can process 
       the manifest or segment in the POST request body but finds 
       the media type cannot be supported it SHOULD return an HTTP 415 
       unsupported media type
   9. In case an unknown error happened during
       the processing of the HTTP 
        POST request a HTTP 404 Bad request SHOULD be returned 
   10. In case the media processing entity cannot 
       proces a segment posted 
       due to missing or incorrect init segment, an HTTP 412 
       unfulfilled condition SHOULD be returned
   11. In case a media source receives an HTTP 412 response, 
       it SHOULD resend "ftyp" and "moov" boxes 
	   
6.6 Requirements for Live Media Source Failover
 
  Live encoder or media ingest source failover is the second type
  of failover scenario that needs to be addressed for end-to-end 
  live streaming delivery. In this scenario, the error condition 
  occurs on the encoder side. The following expectations apply 
  to the live ingestion endpoint when encoder failover happens:
  
  1.    A new encoder or media ingest source instance 
        SHOULD be instantiated to continue streaming
  2.    The new encoder or media ingest source MUST use 
        the same URL for HTTP POST requests as the failed instance.
  3.    The new encoder or media ingest source POST request 
        MUST include the same header boxes moov 
        and ftyp as the failed instance
  4.    The new encoder or media ingest source 
        MUST be properly synced with all other running encoders 
        for the same live presentation to generate synced audio/video 
        samples with aligned fragment boundaries. 
        This implies that UTC timestamps 
        for fragments in the "tdft" match between decoders, 
        and encoders start running at
        an appropriate segment boundaries.
  5.    The new stream MUST be semantically equivalent 
        with the previous stream, and interchangeable 
        at the header and media fragment levels.
  6.    The new encoder or media ingest source SHOULD 
        try to minimize data loss. The basemediadecodetime tdft 
        of media fragments SHOULD increase from the point where 
        the encoder last stopped. The basemediadecodetime in the 
        tdft box SHOULD increase in a continuous manner, but it 
        is permissible to introduce a discontinuity, if necessary. 
        Media processing entities or publishing points can ignore 
        fragments that it has already received and processed, so 
        it is better to error on the side of resending fragments 
        than to introduce discontinuities in the media timeline.
		
7. Profile 2: DASH ingest general considerations
    
   Profile 2 is designed to ingest media into entities that only 
   provide pass through functionality. In this case the media 
   ingest source also provides the manifest based on MPEG DASH[DASH]. 
   
   The flow of operation in profile 2 is shown in Diagram 12. In this 
   case the live ingest source (media source) sends a manifest first. 
   Based on this manifest the media processing entity can setup 
   reception paths for the ingest url http://hostname/presentationpath. 
   
   In the next step segments are send in individual post requests 
   using URLS corresponding to relative paths and segment names in the manifest. 
   e.g. http://hostname/presentationpath/relative_path/segment1.cmf
   
   This profile re-uses as much functionality as posisble from profile 
   1 as the manifest can be seen as a complementary addition to the 
   fragmented MPEG-4 stream. The main difference lies in the way 
   the connection is setup and the way data is transmitted, it largely
   uses the same fragmented MPEG-4 layer based on [ISOBMFF] and [CMAF]

8.  profile 2: DASH ingest protocol behavior

This section describes the protocol behavior specific to 
profile 2: DASH  ingest. Operation of this 
profile MUST also adhere to general requirements in section 4.
	 
8.1  General protocol requirements  

  1. Before sending the segments 
      based on fragmentedMP4Stream the live encoder/source
      MUST send a manifest for DASH [DASH] 
      with the following the limitations/constraints.
   1a. Only relative URL paths to be used for each segment
   1b. Only unique paths are used for each new presentation
   1c. In case the manifest contains these relative paths, 
      these paths SHOULD be used in combination with the 
      POST_URL + relative URLs 
      to POST each of the different segments from 
      the live encoder or ingest source 
      to the processing entity. 

  2. The live encoder or ingest source MAY send 
     updated versions of the manifest,
     this manifest cannot override current 
	 settings and relative paths or break currently running and 
	 incoming POST requests. The updated manifest can only be 
	 slightly different from the one that was send previously, 
	 e.g. introduce new segments available or event messages. 
	 The updated manifest SHOULD be send using a PUT request 
	 instead of a POST request.

  3. Following media segment requests SHOULD be corresponding 
      to the segments listed in the manifest POST_URL + relative URLs.  
	 
  4. The encoder or ingest source SHOULD use individual HTTP POST 
      commands [RFC2626] for uploading media segments when ready. 

  5. In case fixed length POST Commands are used, the live source 
      entity MUST resend the segment to be posted decribed 
	  in the manifest entirely in case of responses HTTP 400, 404
	  412 or 415 together with the init segment consisting 
	  of "moov" and "ftyp" boxes.

  6. A persistent connection SHOULD be used for the different 
        individual POST requests as defined in [HTTP]

8.2  Requirements for formatting media data 

    1. Media data tracks and segments MUST be formatted conforming 
	   to the same requirements as in 6.2  
    2. Media specific information SHOULD also be signalled in the manifest
    3. Formatting described in manifest and media track MUST correspond to each other
		
8.3  Requirements for Timed Text captions and subtitle stream
	
    1. Timed Text captions and subtitle stream tracks and segments MUST 
	   be formatted conforming to the same requirements as in 6.3  
    2. Timed Text captions and subtitle specific information 
	   SHOULD also be signalled in the manifest
    3. Formatting described in manifest and 
	   media track MUST correspond to each other
	   
8.4  Requirements for Timed Metadata
	
     1. Timed Metadata tracks SHOULD be formatted conforming
	    to the same requirements as in 8.4 	
     2. In addition, the emsg box containing the metadata  
     SHOULD also be signalled in inband in the media 
     track as recommended in [CMAF]
     3. DASH event messages SHOULD also be signalled in the Manifest
	  
8.4  Requirements for Media processing entitiy Failover
     1. Requirements for failover are similar as stated in 6.4 
     2. In addition the live encoder source SHOULD resend the manifest
        before sending any track segments	 
	 
8.5  Requirements for Live Media Source Failover

     1. Requirements for failover are similar as stated in 6.5 
     2. In addition the live encoder source SHOULD resend the manifest 
	    before sending any of the segments 	

     
9.  Security Considerations


   Security consideration are extremely important 
   for media ingest. Retrieving media from a illicit
   source can cause inapropriate content 
   to be broadcasted
   and possibly failure of infrastructure. 
   Basic security requirements have been covered in 
   section 4.
   No security considerations except the ones mentioned 
   in this part of the text are expelictly considered. 
   Further security considerations will be updated 
   once they have been investigated. TBD
  

10.  IANA Considerations
   
  This memo includes no request to IANA.
